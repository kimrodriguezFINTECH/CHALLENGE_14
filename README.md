# CHALLENGE_14

## Machine Learning Trading Bot
In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

## Instructions:
Use the starter code file to complete the steps that the instructions outline. The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

1. Establish a Baseline Performance

2. Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

3. Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier

4. Create an Evaluation Report
   -Conclusion

## Conclusion:
In general making a decision about which strategy to implement is highly difficult due to the many factors and variables surrounding the decision. For this case the first model did a pretty good job at predicting an actual trend. However, when we tuned the based algorithim the classification report shows that its predictability is much better. Then again it could be likely that the first model mimics the second model so we would have to run probably 3 more models to make sure my prediction is correct that the first model is the best choice.
